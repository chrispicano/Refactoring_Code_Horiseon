Chris Picano- HTML Index/CSS Style

For this website I cleaned up the css style sheet and also cleaned up generic <div> tags and properly categorized them. I consolidated a few tedious CSS tags where need be as well. By doing this it essentially made the site run smooth and handicap accesable to people who may be blind and using a brail keyboard.
